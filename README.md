Libcamera capture PoC

*Note:* Requires [libcamera](https://libcamera.org/) development packages. You have two options:

- Install using package manager: `sudo apt install libcamera-dev` 
- Build raspberry-pi fork of libcamera: [raspberrypi/libcamera](https://github.com/raspberrypi/libcamera). 

You also need `GLFW` development libs
```bash
sudo apt install libglfw3-dev
```

(Libcamera development is very active. With the latter option, you get the latest version)
